# JavaScript Tutorial
## Lesson 1 - Primitives, Operators, Conditionals

### Getting Started

#### Code

Open the `lesson.js` file in a text editor (e.g. gedit).

#### Output

Open the `index.html` file in a web-browser (e.g. Chrome). Open the developer
tools console (F12) to view logs output from the code.

### Lesson Plan

Other lessons may require specific tasks to be complete before a success
condition is displayed. This lesson has no specific tasks to complete, but it
is encouraged to experiment with the code and output to better understand what's
happening and what's possible.  

Read the entirety of the `lesson.js` file, ignoring only the surrounding lines
`(function () { 'use strict';` and `})();` around the file, which will be
explained in a later lesson. Refer to the developer console in your browser to
see the output from each `console.log` call in the code. Note that the whole
script runs in less than a second, so all of the outputs will be in the console
log all at once when the page loads.
